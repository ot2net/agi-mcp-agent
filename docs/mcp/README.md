# MCP Agent Orchestration Documentation

## Overview

This directory documents the design and implementation of a custom MCP-style agent orchestration framework. The goal is to provide a unified, extensible, and production-ready platform for managing, scheduling, and invoking tasks across multiple LLM agent backends (such as Claude, ChatGPT, and custom REST tools).

## Design Philosophy

This framework is built to:
- Enable seamless integration of diverse agent backends
- Centralize configuration and lifecycle management
- Provide a unified API for tool discovery and invocation
- Support robust error handling, monitoring, and security

## Architecture & Features
- **AgentManager**: Central registry and lifecycle manager for all agent backends
- **TaskScheduler**: Handles task queueing, prioritization, and assignment
- **ToolAggregator**: Aggregates all available tools from registered agents and exposes a unified API
- **ConfigLoader**: Loads and validates configuration for all agents and tools
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Easily add new agent types by subclassing the AgentClient interface
- **Monitoring & Health Checks**: Built-in status endpoints and logging
- **Security**: Secure credential handling and permission checks

## Document Structure

- `architecture.md` *(optional)* — Detailed diagrams and data flows (add as needed)
- `api.md` *(optional)* — REST/gRPC API design and usage
- `agent_plugin.md` *(optional)* — Guide for developing and integrating new agent plugins
- `config.md` *(optional)* — Configuration file format and parameter reference
- `task_scheduler.md` *(optional)* — Task scheduling and prioritization algorithms
- `security.md` *(optional)* — Security, authentication, and permission design

> **Tip:** Start with `agent_orchestration.md` for a comprehensive understanding, then refer to other documents for specific topics.

## Quick Start

1. **Read** `agent_orchestration.md` for the overall design and usage examples.
2. **Review** the configuration section and prepare your `mcp_agents.yaml` or JSON config.
3. **Follow** the code examples to initialize the framework, register agents, and invoke tools.
4. **Extend** by adding new agent types or tools as needed.

## Contribution & Extension

- Contributions are welcome! Please follow the structure and style of existing documents.
- When adding new features or agent types, document your changes in the appropriate markdown file.
- For major design changes, update or add to `architecture.md` and `changelog.md`.
