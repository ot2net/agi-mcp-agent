# Task Scheduling and Prioritization in MCP Agent Orchestration

## Overview

This document details the task scheduling, prioritization, and execution logic for the MCP agent orchestration system.

## Task Queue Structure
- Tasks are stored in a priority queue (heap or sorted list).
- Each task has: `id`, `agent_name` (optional), `tool_name`, `arguments`, `priority`, `dependencies`, `status`, `created_at`, `timeout`.
- Status: `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `timeout`.

## Priority and Dependency Handling
- Tasks with higher `priority` are scheduled first (default: 1-10 scale).
- Tasks with unresolved dependencies remain in `pending` until all dependencies are `completed`.
- Cyclic dependencies are detected and rejected.

## Scheduling Algorithms
- **Round-Robin**: Assigns tasks to available agents in a rotating order.
- **Weighted**: Agents with higher capacity/weight get more tasks.
- **Capability-Aware**: Tasks are assigned to agents that support the required tool and have available capacity.
- **Custom**: Pluggable scheduler interface for advanced strategies.

## Failure, Retry, and Timeout Logic
- Each task has a `timeout` (default: 60s). If not completed, status becomes `timeout`.
- Failed tasks can be retried up to `max_retries` (configurable).
- Exponential backoff is used for retries.
- All failures and retries are logged.

## Concurrency and Rate Limiting
- Each agent can have a `max_concurrent_tasks` limit (see config).
- Global and per-agent rate limits can be enforced.
- Tasks exceeding limits are queued until capacity is available.

## Extensibility
- New scheduling algorithms can be added by subclassing `TaskScheduler` and overriding `select_next_task()`.
- Custom hooks for pre/post scheduling, metrics, and logging.

## Example: Basic Scheduler Code

```python
class TaskScheduler:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.task_queue = []
        self.agents = agents
    def submit_task(self, task):
        heapq.heappush(self.task_queue, (-task.priority, task))
    def select_next_task(self):
        while self.task_queue:
            _, task = heapq.heappop(self.task_queue)
            if self._dependencies_met(task):
                agent = self._find_available_agent(task)
                if agent:
                    return agent, task
                else:
                    heapq.heappush(self.task_queue, (-task.priority, task))
                    break
    def _dependencies_met(self, task):
        return all(dep.status == 'completed' for dep in task.dependencies)
    def _find_available_agent(self, task):
        # Example: round-robin or capability-aware
        ...
```

## Best Practices
- Always log scheduling decisions and failures.
- Monitor queue length and agent utilization.
- Use metrics to tune priorities and concurrency.
- Test with simulated load and edge cases.
