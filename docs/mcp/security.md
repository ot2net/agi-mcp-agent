# Security and Permissions in MCP Agent Orchestration

## Overview

This document describes the security model and permission controls for the MCP agent orchestration system.

## API Authentication & Authorization
- All API endpoints require authentication via API key or OAuth2 token.
- Use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all requests.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) can restrict access to sensitive endpoints (e.g., agent registration, config reload).
- Support for per-user and per-service tokens.

## Agent/Tool-Level Permissions
- Each agent and tool can have an access policy (allow/deny by user, group, or role).
- Permissions are checked before task submission and tool invocation.
- Example policy config:

```yaml
permissions:
  agents:
    chatgpt:
      allowed_users: ["alice", "bob"]
      denied_users: ["eve"]
  tools:
    chatgpt.chat_completion:
      allowed_roles: ["admin", "editor"]
```

## Secret Management
- API keys and tokens should be stored in environment variables or secret managers (not in config files).
- Support for dynamic secret rotation and reload.
- Never log secrets or sensitive data.

## Audit Logging
- All API calls, agent registrations, and tool invocations are logged with timestamp, user, and action.
- Logs are immutable and stored securely for audit/compliance.
- Support for log export and integration with SIEM systems.

## Error and Exception Handling
- All errors are sanitized before returning to clients (no stack traces or sensitive info).
- Internal errors are logged with full details for debugging.
- Rate limiting and brute-force protection for authentication endpoints.

## Best Practices
- Enforce least privilege: only grant required permissions.
- Rotate API keys and tokens regularly.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all network communication.
- Regularly review and update access policies.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with enterprise IAM (LDAP, SSO, etc.).
- Fine-grained, context-aware permissions (e.g., time-based, IP-based).
- Automated anomaly detection and alerting.
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest.
