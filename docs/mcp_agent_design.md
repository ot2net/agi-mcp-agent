# MCP-Style Agent Orchestration Framework Design

## Overview

This document describes the design of a custom agent orchestration framework inspired by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture, but implemented from scratch. The framework enables automated agent management, tool aggregation, and seamless integration with LLM products such as Claude AI and ChatGPT.

## Goals
- **Unified Orchestration**: Manage and schedule tasks across multiple agent backends (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, custom tools).
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Easily add new agent backends or tool servers.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Use a single YAML/JSON config to manage all agent endpoints, credentials, and tool definitions.
- **Automated Lifecycle**: Automatically start, stop, and monitor agent connections.
- **Unified API**: Expose all tools and capabilities through a single, composable interface.

## Architecture

### 1. Core Components
- **AgentManager**: Central registry and lifecycle manager for all agent backends.
- **TaskScheduler**: Handles task queueing, prioritization, and assignment to agents.
- **ToolAggregator**: Aggregates all available tools from registered agents and exposes a unified API.
- **ConfigLoader**: Loads and validates configuration for all agents and tools.
- **AgentClient**: Abstract base for all agent integrations (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, custom REST tools).

### 2. Extensibility
- Each agent backend (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) implements the `AgentClient` interface.
- New tools/agents can be added by subclassing `AgentClient` and updating the config file.
- ToolAggregator dynamically discovers and exposes all registered tools.

### 3. Configuration Example

```yaml
agents:
  claude:
    type: claude
    api_key: "sk-..."
    endpoint: "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/complete"
  chatgpt:
    type: openai
    api_key: "sk-..."
    endpoint: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
  custom_tool:
    type: rest
    endpoint: "https://my-custom-tool/api"
    auth_token: "..."
```

## Usage Flow
1. **Startup**: ConfigLoader loads agent definitions and credentials.
2. **Registration**: AgentManager instantiates and registers all AgentClients.
3. **Tool Discovery**: ToolAggregator queries each agent for available tools/functions.
4. **Task Submission**: User submits a task (e.g., prompt, tool call) to the unified API.
5. **Scheduling**: TaskScheduler assigns the task to the appropriate agent based on type, load, and availability.
6. **Execution**: AgentClient handles the request, returns result or error.
7. **Monitoring**: System tracks agent health, task status, and logs events.

## Example API

```python
# Unified interface for tool calls
tool_aggregator = ToolAggregator(config_path="mcp_agent.yaml")

# List all available tools
print(tool_aggregator.list_tools())

# Call a tool (e.g., ChatGPT completion)
result = tool_aggregator.call_tool(
    agent_name="chatgpt",
    tool_name="chat_completion",
    arguments={"prompt": "Hello, world!"}
)
print(result)
```

## Key Design Considerations
- **Security**: Credentials are loaded securely and never logged.
- **Error Handling**: All agent calls are wrapped with robust error handling and retries.
- **Scalability**: The framework supports concurrent task execution and can be extended to distributed setups.
- **Observability**: Built-in logging and status endpoints for monitoring agent and task health.

## Future Extensions
- Web UI for configuration and monitoring
- Hot-reload of agent config
- Pluggable authentication and rate limiting
- Support for streaming responses and human-in-the-loop workflows

This design provides a robust foundation for building a unified, extensible, and production-ready agent orchestration platform, inspired by MCP but tailored for direct integration with modern LLM APIs and custom tools.
